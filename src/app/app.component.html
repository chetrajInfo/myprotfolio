<span style="font-size:40px;">H</span>ello everyone! I am elated to see you here, taking the time to get to know me a little better. I have had the privilege of being a part of the <span class="abb">IT (Information Technology)</span> industry for over half a decade. My journey into coding and undertaking software projects began in 2010. Back then,
 challenges were aplenty, notably the scarcity of resources and the necessity for adept time management. Nevertheless, my zeal for learning enabled me to delve into the ever-evolving world of programming. I embraced JAVA, an Object-Oriented Language, and honed my skills in designing frameworks and APIs. This, in turn, facilitated the development of applications adhering to the principles of <span class="abb"> RAD (Rapid Application Development).</span>

Throughout this adventure, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse design patterns and the intricacies of the software development life cycle. SDLC and its methodologies have always intrigued me - from the planning stage to creation, testing, deployment, and monitoring. Moreover, I have an insatiable appetite for experimenting with innovative tools and designs that optimize the speed, security, and collaborative aspects of application development.

As for my educational background, I embarked on my academic journey in 2008 by enrolling in a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BScIT) program at the prestigious University in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">North-East India(Sikkim Manipal University)<a href="https://www.smu.edu.in" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">(SMU)</span></a></span> and graduated in 2011. 
<br/><br/>
<!-- </section>

<section class="mydetail">-->
  I furthered my education in the United States, where in 2017, I pursued a degree in Computer Science at the<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> University of Houston Clear Lake<a href="https://www.uhcl.edu" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">(UHCL)</span></a></span> and graduated in year 2022.
  Prior to that, I attained an associate degree from <span style="text-decoration:underline;"> San jacinto Community College<a href="https://www.sanjac.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">(SANJAC)</span></a></span> in year 2016.
<br/><br/>
I spent a significant portion of my life in India, where my studies and work experience immensely aided in acquiring proficiency in <strong>Hindi</strong>, in addition to my native language, <strong>Nepali. English </strong>  has been a part of my life since childhood, functioning as a second language. While in the United States, I embraced the opportunity to learn <strong>Spanish</strong> through friends and college courses. Though I’m not yet fluent, I am confident in my ability to get by in Spanish-speaking countries.
